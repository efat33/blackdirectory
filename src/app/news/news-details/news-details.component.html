                                <p>Tim Davie, Director-General of the BBC joins global leaders&nbsp;from sectors
                                    including business, media, fashion and the arts, who have all signed up as Creative
                                    Ally Champions.</p>
                                <p>Among these Champions are leaders and influencers from Bonnier Books UK, British
                                    Fashion Council, Burberry, The Business of Fashion, Clear Channel, Creative
                                    Industries Federation, Havas UK, LinkedIn UK, Sony Music, TikTok and Universal
                                    Music. All have pledged to develop the next generation of creative leaders from
                                    backgrounds that are currently underrepresented in their organisations, including:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Black, Asian and Minority ethnic talent</li>
                                    <li>Disabled talent</li>
                                    <li>Talent from low income backgrounds</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>They have pledged to demonstrating this commitment to inclusion through the promotion
                                    of allyship, which is where people – at any level in an organisation – can support
                                    colleagues who may have had fewer advantages than them in life. The ambition is that
                                    many more leaders within the creative industry and beyond will also sign up as
                                    allies.</p>
                                <p>To support the Creative Ally Champions the BBC Academy, in association with the USC
                                    Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, led by Dr Stacy L. Smith, has created&nbsp;<a
                                        href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/creativediversity/creative-allies">The Ally
                                        Track</a>&nbsp;– a free online education tool, which organisations and the
                                    public can use via the BBC Creative Diversity website. All of the Creative Ally
                                    Champions have committed to the use of the tool within their organisations.</p>
                                <p>The Ally Tool helps the user think about their own background and how different
                                    experiences can lead to advantages and disadvantages in the workplace. It can also
                                    be used to identify an individual’s strengths and suggest how they might display
                                    allyship at their work. Based on Karen Catlin’s ‘Better Allies- process, the tool
                                    sets out seven types of ally – sponsor, champion, advocate, amplifier, scholar,
                                    upstander and confident. Users are invited to choose which type of ally they would
                                    like to be personally. Over a month the tool will then give practical exercises,
                                    tips and best practice on how to be that ally.</p>
                                <p>The campaign launches with a nationwide out of home campaign which takes inspiration
                                    from iconic BBC test cards, created for free by Havas, with media locations,
                                    including the Storm Chiswick Towers, donated by Clear Channel. Both organisations
                                    have committed to becoming Creative Allies Champions.</p>
                                <p>Next week the BBC will launch the Creative Diversity Plan, which will set out more
                                    detail on the BBC’s ambition to lead the way on diversity within the creative
                                    industry; and the The Creative Allies Initiative supports the wider work from the
                                    BBC’s Creative Diversity Unit, including:</p>

                                            Sarpong launched a toolkit</a>&nbsp;to support the BBC’s creative staff and

                                    inclusion – we all want to find new ways of working that help build a truly
